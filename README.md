TODO: 

-Add other objects to the scene
-Apply force to those objects 
-Add textures 
-Add it so that when the spheres bounce once, they turn into smoke and then quickly disappear. 
-Have a sphere that explodes(disappears) when exploding. 
-Add a button to explode instead of calling in the start


Possible idea: Particles exploding into more particles


In class: 
-Ask if this is enough.
-Ask about avoiding tunneling
